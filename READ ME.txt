Players can name themselves and pick their own color for their chips.

To run the game, run the main.py file. All inputs are done through text.

This file requires all subsidiary files (GameLogic.py, etc) to be in the same folder as the main.py file, along with the respective
text data files. Please ensure that they are all in the same folder.

If unexpected errors occur, it is safe to close the instane of main.py running and relaunch it. However, if a game is currently being played,
then that games data will be lost.
